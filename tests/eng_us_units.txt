UNIT_LORE_AJUNTAPALLSPIRIT_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Little is known about the ancient Sith named Ajunta Pall save that Revan and the companions encountered his spirit deep within a tomb on Korriban. The sheer unbelievability of the story has led many to believe that the tale of a Sith spirit is nothing more than a fable meant to amuse Cantina patrons across the galaxy.\n\n[c][ffff33]Boss Battle:[-][/c] This Boss can attack up to 3 times per turn and will automatically counter attack. He cannot be inflicted with Ability Block, Fear, or Deathmark, or have his cooldowns increased.
UNIT_LORE_AJUNTAPALLSPIRIT_NAME|Ajunta Pall
UNIT_LORE_ANAKINSKYWALKER_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi Padawan, Anakin Skywalker, would become a legendary Jedi Knight, serving as a General of the Clone Army during the Clone Wars where he would lead the 501st Legion with Clone Captain Rex serving at his side. Thought to be the prophesized Chosen One, Anakin's growth in power and skill as a Jedi was second-to-none. He would eventually succumb to the Dark Side of the Force in an attempt to save Padmé Amidala, thereby becoming Darth Vader.
UNIT_LORE_ARC170REX_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Although primarily ground combat specialists, the 501st would occasionally engage in starfighter combat when called upon.

Crewed by 3 troopers and an astromech, the multi-purpose ARC-170 was designed both for short-range dogfights and longer deep-space missions. The ARC-170 could serve as a fighter-bomber and was armed heavily enough to damage the armor of capital ships.
UNIT_LORE_ARCTROOPER_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Advanced Recon Commandos, commonly referred to as ARC troopers, represented the best of the clone army and were given assignments deemed too dangerous for standard troopers. ARC troopers donned specialized armor and equipment.

UNIT_LORE_B1BATTLEDROID_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Built to loosely resemble their Geonosian designers, B1 Battle Droids comprised the backbone of the Separatist war machine. While typically requiring a central command center to operate, B1s were also observed acting independently throughout the Clone Wars. B1s were designed to overwhelm opponents in volume rather than use cunning tactics to outwit them.
UNIT_LORE_B1HEAVYGUNNER_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Separatists augmented their defensive capabilities by deploying mounted heavy repeating blasters that could be operated by rank-and-file B1 Battle Droids. These turrets could turn a standard B1 from little more than a nuisance into a highly-destructive force if not dealt with swiftly, although other B1s could simply step up and continue the fusillade of blaster fire, making this easier said than done.
UNIT_LORE_B2ROCKETTROOPER_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] A substantial upgrade of the B2-RP Battle Droid, the B2 Rocket Trooper was quicker and more lethal than the B2-RP thanks to larger jetpacks and deadlier blasters. B2 Rocket Troopers were uncommon on the battlefield, but seeing one typically meant trouble.
UNIT_LORE_B2SUPERBATTLEDROID_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] B2 Super Battle Droids were developed in the Geonosian foundries as a response to the large number of flaws found with the B1s and their effectiveness in battle. Unlike early B1s, B2s did not require any command signal to operate, giving them independence in battle that allowed them to press the attack until destroyed. B2s could be found on battlefields augmenting Separatist forces throughout the Clone Wars.
UNIT_LORE_BARRISSOFFEE_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] A Mirialan Jedi Padawan training under Luminara Unduli, Barriss Offee served both with and without her master during many battles throughout the Clone Wars.

UNIT_LORE_BENDAKSTARKILLER_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Bendak Starkiller was the champion of the Taris Fighting Arena, and was known throughout the sector for his combat prowess.

UNIT_LORE_BENSOLOEXEGOL_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] After being defeated by Rey at the wreckage of the second Death Star on Kef Bir, Kylo Ren had a vision of the memory of his father, Han Solo.

On many occasions, Boba would take on contracts from the Galactic Empire and Jabba the Hutt, contributing to his legendary status.
UNIT_LORE_BXCOMMANDODROID_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] BX-series Commando Droids were created as elite droid soldiers. While too expensive to mass-produce, the small number of BX-series droids that were produced were used to great effect as infiltrators, with their speed and agility being leveraged in stealthy operations. BX-series droids were often seen with standard blasters but were occasionally armed with Vibroswords better suited to close-quarters combat.
UNIT_LORE_C3PO_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] A protocol droid specializing in human-cyborg relations, C-3PO was an integral part in the Resistance war effort against the First Order. With his extensive translation database including that of ancient Sith dialects, he was crucial in uncovering the hidden Sith world of Exegol.

UNIT_LORE_CALONORD_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Calo Nord was an infamous bounty hunter during Revan's time.

UNIT_LORE_CARTH_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Carth and Revan met on the Republic ship [i]Endar Spire[/i] when it fell under attack by Malak's forces. Together they crash-landed on Taris, rescued Bastila Shan, and went on a galaxy-spanning adventure to find a lost Star Map and defeat Darth Malak.

When the Jedi attacked Revan's ship, Malak sensed an opportunity and fired on his Master.\n\nAfterward, Malak seized control of the Sith Empire and proclaimed himself Dark Lord, never knowing that Revan survived his betrayal. When he learned of Revan's survival, he knew a confrontation was inevitable and planned accordingly.
UNIT_LORE_DARTHMALAK_MYTHICPVE_NAME|Darth Malak
UNIT_LORE_DEATHTROOPER_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Death Troopers are highly specialized and considered to be among the Galactic Empire's most elite soldiers. Outfitted with a heavily modified black suit of protective body armor and a helmet with vocal scramblers these troopers are prepared for any occasion or crisis.

UNIT_LORE_DROIDEKA_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Developed by the Colicoids, Droidekas were among the most feared battle droids in the Separatists' arsenal. Armed with massive twin-blasters and compact deflector shield generators, Droidekas were a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, giving both Clone Troopers and Jedi cause for concern.

UNIT_LORE_EPIXPOE_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] Once a member of the Spice Runners of Kijimi, Poe chose to leave his past behind and enlisted as a pilot within the New Republic, following in the footsteps of his mother.

UNIT_LORE_FOEXECUTIONER_DESC|[c][ffff33]Lore:[-][/c] The First Order used specially-armed troopers to execute anyone suspected to be even the slightest bit treasonous within their ranks.
